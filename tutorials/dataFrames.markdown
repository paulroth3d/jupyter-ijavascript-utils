## D3

D3, specifically: [group / rollup](https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group) and [flatGroup / flatRollup](https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-flatgroup)

## DanfoJS
{@link https://danfo.jsdata.org/|DanfoJS} - a js library heavily inspired by
{@link https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html|Pandas}
so someone familiar with Pandas can get up to speed very quickly

## DataFrame-JS
{@link https://gmousse.gitbooks.io/dataframe-js/|dataframe-js} -
provides an immutable data structure for DataFrames
which allows to work on rows and columns with a sql
and functional programming inspired api.

## StandardLib
{@link https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib|StdLib} - 
is a great library that compiles down to C/C++ level to providespeeds comparable to Numpy.

## NumJS
{@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/numjs | NumJS}
is also a great number processing library.
It may not be as fast as StdLib, but it can sometimes be easier touse.
