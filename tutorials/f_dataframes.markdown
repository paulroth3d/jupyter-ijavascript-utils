### With this Library

This library only intends to ease those getting into Jupyter and Notebooks.

We provide options for:

* [Grouping data](https://jupyter-ijavascript-utils.onrender.com/module-group.html)
* [Reducing](https://jupyter-ijavascript-utils.onrender.com/SourceMap.html)
* [Aggregating Results](https://jupyter-ijavascript-utils.onrender.com/module-aggregate.html)
* [Joining](https://jupyter-ijavascript-utils.onrender.com/module-object.html#.join)
* [Mapping](https://jupyter-ijavascript-utils.onrender.com/module-object.html#.mapByProperty)

and more.

However, this is intended to meet the most common cases.

For more details see the {@tutorial groupingAggregating} tutorial.

### Growing into DataFrames

There are many other libraries that go into detail farther than we will want to provide.

If you are just getting started, I might suggest working with [d3 as a swiss army knife of the internet](https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group)

If you are more familiar with Pandas and DataFrames, I might suggest {@link https://danfo.jsdata.org/|DanfoJS}

Additionally, if you are looking for number processing at hardware accelerated speeds,
I would suggest reviewing other libraries, such as [ScramJet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scramjet)
and {@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/numjs | NumJS}

Additionally, {@link https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib|StdLib} has some amazing work with hardware acceleration and GPU utilization.

For more details see the {@tutorial dataFrames} tutorial.
