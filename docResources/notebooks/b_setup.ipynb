    "\n",
    "If you don't currently manage Python, we would recommend installing the free [Anaconda for Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for most cases.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Anaconda includes Python 3, Jupyter Lab, command line (conda) and a GUI (Anaconda Navigator) to install packages and manage environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that after Anaconda is downloaded, there may be a lengthy 'setup' as it downloads the latest packages (a few minutes and about 3Gb)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a smaller package of Anaconda - called MiniConda - that only includes the conda command line tools, Python and the packages they depend on.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of MiniConda](../img/Anaconda_MiniCondaHome.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As such - it does not include JupyterLab out of the box, but there are some great resources on [how to install miniconda and JupyterLab](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-miniconda-with-python-and-jupyterlab-5ce07845e818), but this might not be the best option for those getting started.\n",
