    "So the modules that you would normally work with for NodeJS will still work, such as [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for working with secrets, [sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) for connecting to ORM data, [s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/s3) for connecting to AWS S3 buckets, or [other modules you are used to](https://npms.io/)\n",

    "Although there are options such as flags and the [esm](https://github.com/standard-things/esm) library - sometimes the simplest option is to just use an older module version (like d3@6.7.0)"
